            Hi, my name is Matt Sharkey. I joined the United States Air Force
            right out of high school. I was enlisted for 10 years, and did 3
            tours overseas. Many adventures and enjoyable moments while I was
            in.

            I had my first taste of coding while I was working with a friend for
            his small company. We built WordPress and html webpages for local
            businesses.
